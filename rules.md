## Rules for page published settings

* The main version in the pages table contains the main 'published' toggle
	* If the toggle is on, the main page is public as well as any other published versions
	* If the toggle is off, all versions are not served
* When you publish a page, that version is made public and will remain public until explicitly unpublished
